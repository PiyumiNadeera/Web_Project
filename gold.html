                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Throughout history, few investments have rivaled gold in popularity as a hedge against almost
                            any kind of trouble, from inflation, to economic upheaval or currency fluctuations, to war.
                            <br>
                            When you think about investing in gold, don’t restrict yourself to just buying physical
                            gold, like coins or bullion. Alternatives to invest in gold include buying shares of gold
                            mining companies or gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). You can also invest in gold by
                            trading options and futures contracts.

                        <h3>How to Invest in Physical Gold</h3>
                        <p>The three main options to invest in physical gold are bullion, coins and jewelry. You'll
                            likely need to pay for storage and obtain insurance for your investment.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Gold Bullion</strong>
                            <br>
                            The current gold price is around $1,900 per ounce (as of September 2020). Gold bullion comes
                            in bars ranging from a few grams to 400 ounces. Due to gold bullion's high price, it's
                            especially important to use a reputable dealer. It's also a good idea to stay up to date on
                            the price of gold.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Gold Coins</strong>
                            <br>
                            The most common gold coins weigh one or two ounces, though half-ounce and quarter-ounce
                            coins are also available. Gold coin prices may not entirely align with their gold content,
                            though. You may be able to find better deals on gold coins from local collectors or pawn
                            shops. It's still typically safer to make purchases using a reputable, licensed dealer.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Gold Jewelry</strong>
                            <br>
                            Investing in gold jewelry carries many risks that investing in pure gold doesn't. First, you
                            have to be careful about jewelry purchases as not all secondhand jewelry is sold by
                            reputable dealers. You'll pay some amount of markup based on which company designed and
                            manufactured the jewelry. This could be anywhere from 20% to three times the precious
                            metal's value. You'll want to consider the melt value, or the raw value of your jewelry's
                            components if it were melted into pure gold.
                            <br>
                            Gold's purity is calculated based on karats, with 24karats being 100% gold. You may be able
                            to find better deals on gold coins from local collectors or pawn shops, but it's still
                            typically safer to make purchases using a reputable, licensed dealer.

                        <h3>Invest in Gold ETFs and Gold Mutual Funds</h3>
                        <p>
                            Investing in gold ETFs and mutual funds can provide you with exposure to gold’s long-term
                            stability while offering more liquidity than physical gold and more diversification than
                            individual gold stocks. There are a range of different types of gold funds. Some are
                            passively managed index funds that track industry trends or the price of bullion using
                            futures or options.
                            <br>
                            The SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), for example, holds physical gold and deposit receipts, and
                            its price tracks the price of physical bullion. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), on the
                            other hand, is a passively managed fund that tracks an underlying basket of stocks of gold
                            mining and refining companies.
                            <br>
                            Gold mutual funds like Franklin Templeton’s Gold and Precious Metals Fund are actively
                            managed by professional investors. These funds aim to beat the returns of passively managed
                            index funds. In exchange, they charge relatively high expense ratios.
                            <br>
                            Just remember, like gold stocks you aren’t buying gold, just paper that is theoretically
                            backed by debt or equity of mining companies or futures and options contracts for physical
                            bullion. This means the value of gold mutual funds and ETFs may not entirely match up with
                            the market price of gold, and these investments may not perform the same as physical gold.

                        <p>
                            Of all the ways to invest in gold, the riskiest is trading futures or options contracts.
                            Futures and options are derivatives, meaning their value is based entirely on the price of
                            an underlying asset. Most online brokerages allow for trading in these securities, but they
                            may require account holders to sign additional forms acknowledging the risk.

                        <h3>Should You Invest in Gold?</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you’re concerned about inflation and other calamities, gold may offer you an investing
                            safe haven. Though in the shorter term it can be just as volatile as stocks, over the very
                            long term, gold has held its value remarkably well.
                            <br>
                            Depending on your own preference and aptitude for risk, you may choose to invest in physical
                            gold, gold stocks, gold ETFs and mutual funds or speculative futures and options contracts.
                            Regardless of the form of gold you choose, most advisors recommend you allocate no more than
                            10% of your portfolio to it.
                            <br>
                            Any form of investing carries risks. Gold is no different. But the idiosyncratic gold market
                            isn’t forgiving and takes a long time to learn. This makes gold ETFs and mutual funds the
                            safest choice for most investors looking to add some of gold’s stability and sparkle to
                            their portfolios.
