                    If you’ve been thinking about moving some of your money into alternative investments, perhaps to have a portion of your portfolio held in counter-cyclical assets, you should take a close look at gold and silver.
                    
                    In this article, were going to focus on how to invest in gold and silver, since there are actually several different ways to go about it. Each comes with its own set of benefits and costs.
                    
                    But before we get into the mechanics of how to invest in gold and silver, let’s start by considering a more fundamental question:

                <h5 class="card-title">Why Invest in Gold and Silver?</h5>
                <p class="card-text">There are several answers to this question.

                    Gold Has Been Money For Thousands of Years
                    Nations, kingdoms, and empires have come and gone over the past 5,000 years, and their currencies have disappeared with them. But gold has continued to function as a medium of exchange and a store of wealth through it all. Along the way, silver has functioned as a parallel precious metal, achieving the title of the poor man’s gold due to its much lower price.

                    Gold and Silver Have Intrinsic Value
                    Modern paper and electronic currencies are conventions. They’re declared to be money by governments, and accepted as such by citizens. But in and of themselves, they have no intrinsic value.
                    <br>
                    Gold and silver, on the other hand, represent physical commodities. Not only are they valued for their rarity, but they also have practical applications. For example, both are used in jewelry fabrication and for certain industrial uses.
                    
                    The screenshot below shows the distribution of gold use in the United States. Note that 34% of gold is used in electronics.

                <h5 class="card-title">Gold as a Counter-cyclical Investment</h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Were going to focus primarily on gold in this section because it’s the more documented of the two precious metals.

                The main arguments against gold as an investment are that 1) it doesn’t pay interest or dividends, and 2) it’s not an all-weather investment (doesn’t perform consistently in all types of market environments).

                Those are legitimate concerns, but they miss what might be the bigger point. Gold is, for the most part, an asset that performs best when the economy and the financial markets are at their worst. That makes gold a true counter-cyclical investment--it’s often the only asset that turns in a positive performance when paper assets are falling.

                The U.S. experienced two periods of extreme crisis since World War II, and gold easily outperformed the financial markets in both.
