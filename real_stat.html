                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Real estate is property consisting of land and the buildings on it, along with its natural
                            resources such as crops, minerals or water; immovable property of this nature; an interest
                            vested in this (also) an item of real property, (more generally) buildings or housing in
                            general. In terms of law, real is in relation to land property and is different from
                            personal property while estate means the "interest" a person has in that land property.

                            Real estate is different from personal property, which is not permanently attached to the
                            land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, tools and the rolling stock of a farm.

                            In the United States, the transfer, owning, or acquisition of real estate can be through
                            business corporations, individuals, nonprofit corporations, fiduciaries, or any legal entity
                            as seen within the law of each U.S. state.

                        <h3>History of real estate</h3>
                        <p>The profession of appraisal can be seen as beginning in England during the 1500s as
                            agricultural needs required land clearing and land preparation. The term "surveying" was
                            used in England, while the term "appraising" was more used in North America. Natural law had
                            an influence in Emerich de Vattel's 1758 "Law of Nations" which conceptualized the idea of
                            private property. The oldest real estate brokrage firm was established in 1855 in Chicago,
                            Illinois. Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act in the U.S., which is also known as the Fair
                            Housing Act, dealt with the incorporation of African Americans into neighborhoods. Internet
                            real estate began with the first appearance of real estate platforms on the World Wide Web
                            in 1999.

                        <p>
                            Residential real estate may contain either a single family or multifamily structure that is
                            available for occupation or for non-business purposes.

                            Residences can be classified by and how they are connected to neighbouring residences and
                            land. Different types of housing tenure can be used for the same physical type. For example,
                            connected residences might be owned by a single entity and leased out, or owned separately
                            with an agreement covering the relationship between units and common areas and concerns.

                            According to the Congressional Research Service, in 2021, 65% of homes in the U.S. are owned
                            by the occupier

                        <h3>Real estate and the environment</h3>
                        <p>
                            Real estate can be valued or devalued based on the amount of environmental degradation that
                            has occurred. Environmental degradation can cause extreme health and safety risks. There is
                            a growing demand for the use of site assessments (ESA's) when valuing a property for both
                            private and commercial real estate.

                            Environmental surveying is made possible by environmental surveyors who examine the
                            environmental factors present within the development of real estate as well as the impacts
                            that development and real estate has on the environment.

                            Green development is a concept that has grown since the 1970s with the environmental
                            movement and the World Commission on Environment and Development. Green development examines
                            social and environmental impacts with real estate and building. There are 3 areas of focus,
                            being the environmental responsiveness, resource efficiency, and the sensitivity of cultural
                            and societal aspects. Examples of Green development are green infrastructure, LEED,
                            conservation development, and sustainability developments.

                            Real estate in itself has been measured as a contributing factor to the rise in green house
                            gases. According to the International Energy Agency, real estate in 2019 was responsible for
                            39 percent of total emissions worldwide and 11 percent of those emissions were due to the
                            manufacturing of materials used in buildings.

                        <h3>As an investment</h3>
                        <p>
                            In markets where land and building prices are rising, real estate is often purchased as an
                            investment, whether or not the owner intends to use the property. Often investment
                            properties are rented out, but "flipping" involves quickly reselling a property, sometimes
                            taking advantage of arbitrage or quickly rising value, and sometimes after repairs are made
                            that substantially raise the value of the property.

                            Luxury real estate is sometimes used as a way to store value, especially by wealthy
                            foreigners, without any particular attempt to rent it out. Some luxury units in London and
                            New York City have been used as a way for corrupt foreign government officials and
                            businesspeople from countries without strong rule of law to launder money or to protect it
                            from seizure
