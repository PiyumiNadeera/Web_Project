                <h5 class="card-title">Introduction</h5>
                <p class="card-text">A stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of buyers and
                    sellers of stocks (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may
                    include securities listed on a public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded
                    privately, such as shares of private companies which are sold to investors through equity
                    crowdfunding platforms. Investment is usually made with an investment strategy in mind.

                <h5 class="card-title">History</h5>
                <p class="card-text">In 12th-century France, the courtiers de change were concerned with managing and
                    regulating the debts of agricultural communities. Because these men also traded with debts, they
                    could
                    be called the first brokers. In 1409 Bruges became the "Brugse Beurse", institutionalizing what had
                    been
                    an informal meeting. The Dutch East India Company (founded in 1602) was the first joint-stock
                    company to
                    get a fixed capital stock and as a result, continuous trade in company stock occurred on the
                    Amsterdam
                    Exchange. The practice of short selling was banned by the Dutch authorities as early as 1610.

                <p class="card-text">
                    The stock market is one of the most important ways for companies to raise money. Central banks tend
                    to keep an eye on the control and behavior of the stock market. The price of assets is an important
                    part of the dynamics of economic activity. It can influence or be an indicator of social mood and
                    economic development.
