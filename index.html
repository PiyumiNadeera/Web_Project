            <h1>Investments for a secured future</h1>
            <p class="lead">An investment is an asset or item acquired with the goal of generating income or
                appreciation.
                Appreciation refers to an increase in the value of an asset over time. When an individual purchases a
                good as an investment,
                the intent is not to consume the good but rather to use it in the future to create wealth.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p class="description">The Code of Hammurabi (around 1700 BC) provided a legal framework for investment,
                    establishing a means for the pledge of collateral by codifying debtor and creditor rights in regard
                    to pledged land. Punishments for breaking financial obligations were not as severe as those for
                    crimes involving injury or death.
                    <br>
                    In the medieval Islamic world, the qirad was a major financial instrument. This was an arrangement
                    between one or more investors and an agent where the investors entrusted capital to an agent who
                    then traded with it in hopes of making a profit. Both parties then received a previously settled
                    portion of the profit, though the agent was not liable for any losses. Many will notice that the
                    qirad is similar to the institution of the commenda later used in western Europe,
                    though whether the qirad transformed into the commenda or the two institutions evolved independently
                    cannot be stated with certainty.

                    <br>
                    In the early 1900s, purchasers of stocks, bonds, and other securities were described in media,
                    academia, and commerce as speculators. Since the Wall Street crash of 1929, and particularly by the
                    1950s, the term investment had
                    come to denote the more conservative end of the securities spectrum, while speculation was applied
                    by financial brokers and their
                    advertising agencies to higher risk securities much in vogue at that time. Since the last half of
                    the 20th century, the terms speculation and speculator have specifically referred to higher risk
                    ventures.

                <h2>Investment and risk</h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p class="description">
                    An investor may bear a risk of loss of some or all of their capital invested. Investment differs
                    from arbitrage, in which profit is generated without investing capital or bearing risk.
                    <br>
                    Savings bear the (normally remote) risk that the financial provider may default.

                    <br>
                    Foreign currency savings also bear foreign exchange risk: if the currency of a savings account
                    differs from the account holder's home currency, then there is the risk that the exchange rate
                    between the two currencies will move unfavourably so that the value of the savings account
                    decreases, measured in the account holder's home currency.

                    <br> Even investing in tangible assets like property has its risk. And just like with most risk,
                    property
                    buyers can seek to mitigate any potential risk by taking out mortgage and by borrowing at a lower
                    loan to security ratio.
                    <br>
                    In contrast with savings, investments tend to carry more risk, in the form of both a wider variety
                    of risk factors and a greater level of uncertainty.
                    <br>
                    Industry to industry volatility is more or less of a risk depending. In biotechnology, for example,
                    investors look for big profits on companies that have small market capitalizations but can be worth
                    hundreds of millions quite quickly.The risk is high because approximately 90% of biotechnology
                    products researched do not make it to market due to regulations and the complex demands within
                    pharmacology as the average prescription drug takes 10 years and US$2.5 billion worth of capital.

                <hr>
                <br>
                <p class="description">
                    Investments are often made indirectly through intermediary financial institutions. These
                    intermediaries include pension funds, banks, and insurance companies. They may pool money received
                    from a number of individual end investors into funds such as investment trusts, unit trusts, and
                    SICAVs to make large-scale investments. Each individual investor holds an indirect or direct claim
                    on the assets purchased, subject to charges levied by the intermediary, which may be large and
                    varied.

                    Approaches to investment sometimes referred to in marketing of collective investments include dollar
                    cost averaging and market timing
