                    <p class="card-text text-white">A fixed deposit (FD) is a financial product offered by banks or NBFCs that, up until the specified maturity date, offers investors a higher rate of interest than a typical savings account. It might or might not call for the creation of a different account. It is referred to as a fixed deposit in India and the United States, as a term deposit or time deposit in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, as a bond in the United Kingdom, and as a fixed deposit when compared to a recurrent deposit or a demand deposit before maturity. Some banks might provide FD holders with extra services like competitively priced loans secured by FD certificates.
                   <br><br>
                   It's vital to remember that banks could provide lower interest rates when the economy is shaky. The interest rate ranges from 4% to 7.50%. [1] An FD's term can range from 7, 15, or 45 days to 1.5 years and up to 10 years. [2] Because they are protected by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation, these investments are safer than Post Office Schemes (DICGC). DICGC guarantees, however, only go up to 500000 (about $6850) per depositor per bank. [3] They also provide benefits for income and wealth taxes.

                    <p class="card-text text-white">Term deposits (FDs) are high-interest-yielding term deposits and are offered by banks. FDs compensate for the low liquidity of saving accounts by offering higher rates of interest. The longest permissible term for FDs is 10 years, but a bank may offer a lower rate of interest for a longer period if it expects interest rates to dip in the future. Banks issue a separate receipt for every FD because each deposit is treated as a distinct contract. For example, a deposit is made for 5 years at 8% but is withdrawn after 2 years.

                        If the rate applicable on the date of deposit for 2 years is 5 percent, the interest will be paid at 5 percent. Banks can charge a penalty for premature withdrawal.

                    <p class="card-text text-white">
                        In India, tax is deducted at source by the banks on FDs if interest paid to a customer at any bank exceeds ₹ 10,000 in a financial year. This is applicable to both interest payable or reinvested per customer. This is called Tax deducted at Source and is presently fixed at 10% of the interest. With CBS banks can tally FD holding of a customer across various branches and TDS is applied if interest exceeds ₹ 10,000. Banks issue Form 16 A every quarter to the customer, as a receipt for Tax Deducted at Source.

                    However, tax on interest from fixed deposits is not 10%; it is applicable at the rate of tax slab of the deposit holder. If any tax on Fixed Deposit interest is due after TDS, the holder is expected to declare it in Income Tax returns and pay it by himself.

                    If the total income for a year does not fall within the overall taxable limits, customers can submit a Form 15 G (below 60 years of age) or Form 15 H (above 60 years of age) to the bank when starting the FD and at the start of every financial year to avoid TDS.

                    <p class="card-text text-white">
                        In certain macroeconomic conditions (particularly during periods of high inflation) a Central Bank adopts a tight monetary policy, that is, it hikes the interest rates at which it lends to banks ("repo rates"). Under such conditions, banks also hike both their lending (i.e. loan) as well as deposit (FD) rates. Under such conditions of high FD rates, FDs become an attractive investment avenue as they offer good returns and are almost completely secure with no risk[citation needed]. These can be checked with the excess rates in the country.
